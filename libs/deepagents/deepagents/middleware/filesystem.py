    Ensures paths are safe to use by preventing directory traversal attacks

    forward slashes and start with a leading slash.

    This function is designed for virtual filesystem paths and rejects
    Windows absolute paths (e.g., C:/..., F:/...) to maintain consistency
    and prevent path format ambiguity.

    Args:
        path: The path to validate and normalize.

            the normalized path must start with one of these prefixes.

LIST_FILES_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Lists all files in the filesystem, filtering by directory.

Usage:
- The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- The list_files tool will return a list of all files in the specified directory.
- This is very useful for exploring the file system and finding the right file to read or edit.
- You should almost ALWAYS use this tool before using the Read or Edit tools."""

READ_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Reads a file from the filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 500 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
  - First scan: read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure
  - Read more sections: read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
  - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(path, offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it."""

EDIT_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance."""


WRITE_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Writes to a new file in the filesystem.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- The content parameter must be a string
- The write_file tool will create the a new file.
- Prefer to edit existing files over creating new ones when possible."""


GLOB_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Find files matching a glob pattern.

Usage:
- The glob tool finds files by matching patterns with wildcards
- Supports standard glob patterns: `*` (any characters), `**` (any directories), `?` (single character)
- Patterns can be absolute (starting with `/`) or relative
- Returns a list of absolute file paths that match the pattern

Examples:
- `**/*.py` - Find all Python files
- `*.txt` - Find all text files in root
- `/subdir/**/*.md` - Find all markdown files under /subdir"""

GREP_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Search for a pattern in files.

Usage:
- The grep tool searches for text patterns across files
- The pattern parameter is the text to search for (literal string, not regex)
- The path parameter filters which directory to search in (default is the current working directory)
- The glob parameter accepts a glob pattern to filter which files to search (e.g., `*.py`)
- The output_mode parameter controls the output format:
  - `files_with_matches`: List only file paths containing matches (default)
  - `content`: Show matching lines with file path and line numbers
  - `count`: Show count of matches per file

Examples:
- Search all files: `grep(pattern="TODO")`
- Search Python files only: `grep(pattern="import", glob="*.py")`
- Show matching lines: `grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")`"""

EXECUTE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Executes a given command in the sandbox environment with proper handling and security measures.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the ls tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command
   - Capture the output of the command

Usage notes:
  - The command parameter is required
  - Commands run in an isolated sandbox environment
  - Returns combined stdout/stderr output with exit code
  - If the output is very large, it may be truncated
  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like find and grep. Instead use the grep, glob tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like cat, head, tail, and use read_file to read files.
  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings)
    - Use '&&' when commands depend on each other (e.g., "mkdir dir && cd dir")
    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd

Examples:
  Good examples:
    - execute(command="pytest /foo/bar/tests")
    - execute(command="python /path/to/script.py")
    - execute(command="npm install && npm test")

  Bad examples (avoid these):
    - execute(command="cd /foo/bar && pytest tests")  # Use absolute path instead
    - execute(command="cat file.txt")  # Use read_file tool instead
    - execute(command="find . -name '*.py'")  # Use glob tool instead
    - execute(command="grep -r 'pattern' .")  # Use grep tool instead

Note: This tool is only available if the backend supports execution (SandboxBackendProtocol).
If execution is not supported, the tool will return an error message."""

    This middleware adds filesystem tools to the agent: `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
    `edit_file`, `glob`, and `grep`. Files can be stored using any backend that implements
    the `BackendProtocol`.

    If the backend implements `SandboxBackendProtocol`, an `execute` tool is also added
    for running shell commands.

    This middleware also automatically evicts large tool results to the file system when
    they exceed a token threshold, preventing context window saturation.

    Args:
        backend: Backend for file storage and optional execution.

            If not provided, defaults to `StateBackend` (ephemeral storage in agent state).

            For persistent storage or hybrid setups, use `CompositeBackend` with custom routes.

            For execution support, use a backend that implements `SandboxBackendProtocol`.
        system_prompt: Optional custom system prompt override.
        custom_tool_descriptions: Optional custom tool descriptions override.
        tool_token_limit_before_evict: Token limit before evicting a tool result to the
            filesystem.

            Defaults to 20,000 tokens.

            When exceeded, writes the result using the configured backend and replaces it
            with a truncated preview and file reference.

    Example:
        ```python
        from deepagents.middleware.filesystem import FilesystemMiddleware

        from langchain.agents import create_agent
