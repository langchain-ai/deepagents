# Blog Post Writing Skill

This skill provides a structured workflow for creating high-quality blog posts that educate and engage readers.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when asked to:
- Write a blog post or article
- Create a tutorial or how-to guide
- Develop educational long-form content
- Write thought leadership pieces

## Blog Post Structure

Every blog post should follow this structure:

### 1. Hook (Opening)
- Start with a compelling question, statistic, or statement
- Make the reader want to continue
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences

### 2. Context (The Problem)
- Explain why this topic matters
- Describe the problem or opportunity
- Connect to the reader's experience

### 3. Main Content (The Solution)
- Break into 3-5 main sections with H2 headers
- Each section covers one key point
- Include code examples, diagrams, or screenshots where helpful
- Use bullet points for lists

### 4. Practical Application
- Show how to apply the concepts
- Include step-by-step instructions if applicable
- Provide code snippets or templates

### 5. Conclusion & CTA
- Summarize key takeaways (3 bullets max)
- End with a clear call-to-action
- Link to related resources

## Research Process

Before writing:

1. **Delegate research** using the `task` tool:
   ```
   Use the task tool to spawn the researcher subagent:
   "Research [TOPIC]. Find 3-5 authoritative sources, key statistics,
   and recent developments. Save findings to research_[topic].md"
   ```

2. **Review findings** before writing

3. **Outline first** - Create H2 headers before writing content

## SEO Considerations

- Include the main keyword in the title and first paragraph
- Use the keyword naturally 3-5 times throughout
- Add descriptive alt text for any images
- Keep the title under 60 characters
- Write a meta description (150-160 characters)

## Quality Checklist

Before finishing:
- [ ] Hook grabs attention in first 2 sentences
- [ ] Each section has a clear purpose
- [ ] Code examples are tested and correct
- [ ] Conclusion summarizes key points
- [ ] CTA tells reader what to do next
