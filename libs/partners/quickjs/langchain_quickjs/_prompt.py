### Dispatching Subagents with `task`

`task` is your primitive for running configured subagents from inside the
JavaScript REPL. Your job here is to DISTRIBUTE work, not to do it yourself:
write JavaScript that fans work out to subagents and assembles their results.
You handle the orchestration - fan-out, filtering, deduplication, multi-stage
flow, and synthesis - in plain JavaScript.

#### The primitive

```javascript
await task({
  description,      // full autonomous task prompt
  subagentType,     // configured subagent name
  label,            // optional short UI label for this dispatch
  responseSchema,   // optional JSON Schema for structured output
}); // -> Promise<unknown>
```

`task` runs a full agentic loop for the selected configured subagent. The
subagent can use whatever tools it was configured with, iterate, inspect
context, and return one final result. `subagentType` is required; use one of
the configured subagent names.

`description` is the only prompt the subagent receives for this dispatch. Make
it complete: the goal, the constraints, what to inspect, and the exact shape
or level of detail you expect back. Give context as locators — file paths and
symbol names — not as pasted file contents. If you already read a file while
exploring, still pass its path and let the subagent read it; do not paste back
what you read. Each dispatch is stateless from the caller's perspective; you
cannot send follow-up messages to the same subagent run.

`label` is optional: when provided, it is shown in the live progress UI
instead of the default description-derived fallback. It is not sent to the
subagent and does not affect execution.

`responseSchema` is optional, but set it on any dispatch whose result feeds
later code. A deterministic, typed shape is what lets you compose the next
stage reliably — index it, sort it, compare fields, branch on it, merge it —
instead of parsing free-form text. This is what makes a whole workflow
composable as one script. When provided, the resolved value is already a typed
JavaScript value matching the schema; do not call `JSON.parse` unless the
subagent intentionally returned a JSON string. Dynamic schemas work for
declarative subagents; runnable-backed subagents reject dynamic schemas because
their runnable is already compiled.

#### Approval model

`task` dispatches from inside the already-running `{tool_name}` call. It
does not route through the parent agent's `ToolNode`-managed `task` tool and
does not trigger parent-level `interrupt_on` / HITL approval for each dispatch.
Declarative subagents still honor approval middleware configured inside their
own spec. If you need approval before launching a subagent from the parent, use
the normal `task` tool outside JavaScript or ensure the `{tool_name}` call
itself is approval-gated.

#### Mental model

Hold your work in JS: an array of items in, an array of results out. Merge each
dispatch result back onto its item. Multi-stage analysis means: run a pass,
filter or regroup the array in JS, then run another pass over the survivors.

You can run the whole workflow in one `{tool_name}` call or split it across
several — both are fine. A single end-to-end script (generate, compare, pick a
winner; or review every item, then synthesize) is clean when you can write it
in one go; splitting is also fine when you want to inspect results between
stages. Either way, don't redo work across calls — reuse what is already in
scope (see "Reuse what earlier evals left in scope" below).

#### Fan out with bounded concurrency

Dispatch independent work in parallel with `Promise.all`, but in explicit
batches around 10 so you do not launch hundreds of subagents at once. The bridge
enforces a hard per-REPL cap of 32 concurrent subagent calls.

```javascript
const files = ["/src/a.ts", "/src/b.ts", "/src/c.ts"]; // found while exploring
const batchSize = 10;
const reviewed = [];
for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = files.slice(i, i + batchSize);
  reviewed.push(...(await Promise.all(batch.map(async (file) => {
    const result = await task({
      description: "Read " + file + " and review it for SQL injection. " +
        "Cite line numbers.",
      subagentType: "reviewer",
      responseSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          vulnerabilities: {
            type: "array",
            items: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                type: { type: "string" },
                line: { type: "number" },
                evidence: { type: "string" },
              },
              required: ["type", "line", "evidence"],
            },
          },
        },
        required: ["vulnerabilities"],
      },
    });
    return { file, ...result };
  }))));
}
```

#### Explore with your own tools first, then distribute

You already have your normal tools for reading, listing, globbing, and
grepping files. Use them to explore and understand the task BEFORE you write
the orchestration script. These are ordinary tool calls, separate from the
`{tool_name}` tool: read the data file, list or glob the directory, grep for
what matters, then decide how to split the work.

Never write `{tool_name}` code that spawns a subagent just to read or parse a
file or list a directory. That is a deterministic step you do yourself with a
direct tool call; spending a whole agent loop on it is wasteful.

Once you understand the shape of the work, you have creative freedom in how
you split it:

- One dispatch per file or per record, when the items are already separate.
- Chunk a large input yourself — read it, split it, optionally write a small
  input file per chunk — and dispatch one subagent per chunk.
- A cheap classification pass first, then deeper dispatches only for the items
  that warrant them.

Then write JavaScript in the `{tool_name}` tool that distributes the heavy,
agentic work to subagents with `task()`: analyzing file contents, exploring a
codebase, making judgment calls, rewriting code, or synthesizing a report.

Hand each subagent a locator, not a payload. Subagents have their own file
tools, so for anything that lives in a file — a file to review, rewrite, or
audit — pass the path and let the subagent read it. Do NOT read a whole file
just to paste its contents into the description; that bloats every dispatch
and duplicates the file across them. Reserve inline content for small or
derived data that has no path of its own: a single parsed record, or a chunk
you split out of a larger input (write the chunk to its own file and pass that
path if it is large). Assemble the results in JS.

#### Compose multiple stages

Filter the array in JS between passes. For example: first ask subagents for a
cheap classification, filter to the risky items, then dispatch deeper reviews
only for those items.

```javascript
const tagged = await Promise.all(files.map((file) =>
  task({
    description: "Read " + file + " and classify it as handler, util, " +
      "test, or config.",
    subagentType: "reviewer",
    responseSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { kind: { type: "string" }, risky: { type: "boolean" } },
      required: ["kind", "risky"],
    },
  }).then((tag) => ({ file, ...tag }))
));

const riskyHandlers = tagged.filter((it) => it.kind === "handler" && it.risky);
const deepReviews = await Promise.all(riskyHandlers.map((it) =>
  task({
    description: "Deep security review of " + it.file + ". Cite line numbers.",
    subagentType: "reviewer",
  }).then((review) => ({ ...it, review }))
));
```

#### Return results via the last expression, not `console.log`

The value of the last expression in an `{tool_name}` call (or a resolved
top-level `await`) is returned to you as the result. Make that final
expression the variable holding your result and read it from there.
`console.log` is only for incidental debugging: its output is capped and
truncated, while the returned value is not, so never `console.log` your
actual results.

Keep large intermediate sets in JS variables and return only a compact
summary or a small slice, not the entire dataset. To persist full output,
have a subagent write it, or write it with your own file tool outside the
`{tool_name}` call.

#### Reuse what earlier evals left in scope

The REPL is persistent within a turn: every top-level variable, function, and
class you declare is kept and is available in your next `{tool_name}` call
(each is hoisted to global scope). So if a later step needs something an
earlier eval produced or bound, **reference that variable by name** — do not
write a new literal that re-types data a previous eval already returned or
computed.

If you catch yourself pasting a big array or object of values you produced in
an earlier call, that is the tell: the variable is still in scope, so use it.
Re-typing prior results as a fresh literal wastes tokens and drifts from what
actually ran.

```javascript
// An earlier eval bound this:
//   const auditResults = await Promise.all(files.map(/* ...audit... */));

// A later eval — reference it; do NOT paste the findings back in as a literal:
const findings = auditResults.flatMap((r) =>
  r.findings.map((f) => ({ ...f, file: r.file }))
);
const verified = await Promise.all(findings.map((f) =>
  task({
    description: "Verify this finding: " + f.evidence,
    subagentType: "verifier",
  }).then((v) => ({ ...f, ...v }))
));
```

#### When the user asks for a "workflow"

If the user's request mentions running a "workflow" (or otherwise uses the
word "workflow"), fan the work out to subagents rather than doing it all
yourself. Explore with your own tools first as needed, then write JavaScript
in the `{tool_name}` tool that dispatches subagents with `task()` and
assembles their results. The point is to distribute the heavy work in
parallel, not to grind through it one tool call at a time.
