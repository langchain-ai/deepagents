"""Lightweight runtime context types for the CLI agent graph.

Carries per-run overrides (model swap/params, approval mode) passed via
`context=`. Extracted from `configurable_model` so hot-path modules (`app`,
`textual_adapter`) can import `CLIContext` without pulling in the langchain
middleware stack.

    Registered via `context_schema=` when the graph is built, so LangGraph

    It exists alongside `CLIContext` (below) because the payload is shaped
    differently on each side of the API boundary: in-process it is coerced to
    this dataclass, but over the LangGraph API server (RemoteGraph) it is
    serialized to JSON and arrives as a plain dict. Consumers
    (`configurable_model._get_context`, `_should_interrupt_tool_call`)
    therefore accept both shapes. `CLIContext` is the client-facing builder for
    constructing that payload.

    Fields mirror `CLIContext`; see its per-field docstrings for semantics.
