# Creates release PRs based on conventional commits.
#
# When commits land on master, release-please analyzes them and either:
# - Creates/updates a release PR with changelog and version bump
# - When a release PR is merged, triggers the release workflow
#
# GitHub releases are created by release.yml after all checks pass,
# not by release-please directly (skip-github-release: true in config).
