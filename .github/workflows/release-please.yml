# Creates release PRs and GitHub releases based on conventional commits.
#
# When commits land on master, release-please analyzes them and either:
# - Creates/updates a release PR with changelog and version bump
# - When a release PR is merged, creates a GitHub release with tags
#
# PyPI publishing is handled by release.yml, which triggers on the
# GitHub release created by this workflow.
