# Python Programming Course (Beginners)

This is a beginner-friendly Python course built to be used **with Git**. The repo is structured as a set of modules with notes, exercises, and small projects.

## Who this is for
- First-time programmers or near-beginners
- Comfortable using a computer, willing to use the terminal

## Learning outcomes
By the end, learners can:
- Use the terminal, create folders/files, run Python scripts
- Use Git: commit early/often, create branches, open PRs (optional), resolve simple conflicts
- Write Python programs using variables, types, control flow, functions, and common data structures
- Read/write files, handle errors, and structure small projects
- Write basic tests and debug effectively

## Repo layout
- `00-setup/` 
0Setup, terminal, Git/GitHub workflow
- `01-basics/` 
0Python fundamentals
- `02-control-flow/` 
0Conditionals, loops
- `03-functions/` 
0Functions, scope
- `04-data-structures/` 
0Lists, tuples, dicts, sets, strings
- `05-files/` 
0Reading/writing files, CSV/JSON
- `06-modules-and-packages/` 
0Imports, packages, venv, dependencies
- `07-testing-and-debugging/` 
0Tracebacks, debugging, pytest
- `08-projects/` 
0Mini-projects + capstone
- `99-reference/` 
0Cheatsheets, rubric, checklists
- `templates/` 
0Reusable lesson/exercise templates

## Suggested pacing
Use as a **6-week course** (standard) or compress/extend.
- 2	10 hours/week total (lecture/demo + practice)
- Each module ends with exercises; projects are in `08-projects/`

## How learners should use Git (default workflow)
- Create a branch per exercise/project: `git switch -c exercise/01-variables`
- Commit small increments: `git commit -am "Add solution for variables exercises"`
- (Optional) Push to GitHub and open PRs for review

## Start here
Go to `00-setup/README.md`.
