## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Read the Learning Path
Start by reading `LEARNING_PATH.md` for a detailed guide through all modules.

### 2. Start with Module 1
```bash
python modules/01_basics.py
```

### 3. Follow the Pattern for Each Module
- Read the module file to understand concepts
- Run the file to see examples in action
- Complete the exercises in `exercises/`
- Check your work against `solutions/`

### 4. Run the Tests
```bash
# Install pytest if needed
pip install pytest

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_exercises.py -v
```

### 5. Try the Final Project
```bash
python projects/project_01_todo_app.py
```

## 📖 How to Use This Course

### Study Method
1. **Read the lesson** - Understand concepts and examples
2. **Run the code** - See it in action
3. **Try exercises** - Apply what you learned
4. **Check solutions** - Learn better approaches
5. **Refine your code** - Practice variations

### Tips for Success
- ✓ Type code yourself - don't copy/paste
