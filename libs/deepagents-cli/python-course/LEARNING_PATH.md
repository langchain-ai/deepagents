## 🚀 Final Projects

### Project 1: Todo Application
**File:** `projects/project_01_todo_app.py`

**What You'll Build:**
A complete command-line todo application that:
- Manages a list of tasks with priorities
- Saves tasks to a file
- Allows searching and filtering
- Tracks completion status
- Demonstrates all 5 modules combined

**Skills Applied:**
- Classes and objects (Module 5)
- File I/O (Module 4)

## 📖 How to Use This Course

### Study Method

1. **Read the Module:** Open the module file and read through all code and comments
2. **Run the Module:** Execute it to see examples in action
3. **Understand Examples:** Make sure you understand what each example does
4. **Do Exercises:** Try to solve each exercise without looking at solutions
5. **Check Solutions:** Compare your code with the provided solutions
6. **Refine Your Code:** Learn better approaches from the solutions

### Tips for Success

- **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy/paste. Typing helps learning.
- **Run and modify examples** - Change values and see what happens
- **Take breaks** - Don't try to learn everything in one sitting
- **Debug your own code** - Use print statements to understand what's happening
- **Challenge yourself** - Try the challenge exercises and create variations
- **Ask "why?"** - Understand the reasoning behind the code, not just the syntax

### Pacing Guide

- **Fast learner:** 1 module per day = 5 days total
- **Moderate pace:** 1 module every 2 days = 10 days total  
- **Thorough learner:** 1-2 modules per week = 3-5 weeks total

Take the pace that works for you. Understanding is more important than speed.
